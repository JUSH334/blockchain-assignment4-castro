# Short Note - Safety checks/UX touches you added

Implementation Notes - Team 08 DApp
Extra Safety Checks & UX Enhancements
Our implementation includes several safety and usability improvements beyond the base requirements:
Input Validation: All addresses are validated using Viem's getAddress function, which checks for valid checksums and prevents sending tokens to malformed addresses. Amount inputs are sanitized to prevent negative values and properly handle decimal precision.
Transaction Feedback: Users receive real-time status updates during transfers - a yellow "Submitted" message appears immediately with the transaction hash, followed by a green "Mined" confirmation showing block number and gas used. This dual-stage feedback prevents user confusion during pending transactions.
Persistent Storage: Token addresses are automatically saved to localStorage, eliminating the need to re-enter contract addresses after page refreshes. The team selection also persists, streamlining the development workflow.
Auto-refresh on Events: The balance automatically updates when Transfer events involving the connected account are detected, using Viem's watchContractEvent. This ensures users always see current balances without manual refreshing.
Issues Encountered & Resolutions
MetaMask File Protocol Issue: Initially attempted to open the HTML file directly (file:///), which caused MetaMask content script errors ("SES_UNCAUGHT_EXCEPTION"). Solution: Served the application through a Python HTTP server (python3 -m http.server 8000) to use proper http://localhost:8000 URLs, enabling proper MetaMask injection.
RPC Connection Failures: The team RPC endpoint (https://hh-08.didlab.org) experienced intermittent availability. Solution: Implemented fallback configuration to allow quick switching to local Hardhat node (http://localhost:8545) during development, ensuring continuous workflow even when remote infrastructure was unavailable.
Browser Compatibility: Firefox's strict security policies initially blocked MetaMask interactions. Solution: Used Chrome for primary development and testing, while ensuring cross-browser compatibility in the final implementation.
These enhancements and solutions resulted in a robust, user-friendly DApp that handles edge cases gracefully while maintaining a smooth development experience.
